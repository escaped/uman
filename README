UltraStar Manager
=================

With this song management application you are able to keep an eye on your UltraStar collection. Quickly find songs with missing covers, backgrounds or videos.

How to compile
---------------
You need to install Homebrew (http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/) on OSX followed by these commands:
brew install qt
brew install taglib
cd /usr/local/
git add remote escaped git://github.com/escaped/homebrew.git
git pull escaped master
brew install libbass

Now you can compile using QT Creator.

About this repo
---------------
This is just a git-Repo for some Bugfixes, Mac-Compatibility and perhaps new Features.

I hope these changes will merge into the original Project-Repo.
